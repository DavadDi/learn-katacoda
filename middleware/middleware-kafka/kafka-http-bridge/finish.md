Exposing the Apache Kafka cluster to clients using HTTP enables scenarios where use of the native clients is not desirable. Such situations include resource constrained devices, network availability and security considerations. Interaction with the bridge is similar to the native Apache Kafka clients but using the semantics of an HTTP REST API. 

The general availability of the HTTP Bridge in Red Hat Integration enhances the options available to developers when building applications with Apache Kafka.
